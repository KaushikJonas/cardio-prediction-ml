🫀 Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

This project focuses on building a predictive model to detect the risk of cardiovascular diseases using health-related features such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, BMI, and more. The goal is to help identify individuals at risk and potentially assist healthcare professionals with early diagnosis.
